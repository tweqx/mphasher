Misc/Weird:
 02075535.com: Part of an unrealted ARG, for more information see https://discord.com/channels/572330844056715284/588898466512633876/942420834088271902
 gikade.com: website part of a CTF? Random website?
 hanauma-bay-hawaii.com: hawaii tourist website? Why is an invalid PGP message hidden in an HTML comment?
 hoopstress.com: contains a random 256 hex string and a PGP message hidden within a HTML comment? The PGP signature is owned by Steven Baltakatei Sandoval, a developper.
 indigenize.com: website about native americans/indigneous people? Within an HTML comment there is a malformatted PGP message and a hexstring
 wattmarck.com: emulates a windows 95/98-type interface about a music record company? Perhaps an ARG?
 ca.mailpal.com, ca.srve.com, emsvr.com, my.guardpuppy.com: redirects to http://www.emsvr.com/746,184,0872,934.html which seems to be a company website about some kind of website protection? The code contains a lot of obfuscated JS
